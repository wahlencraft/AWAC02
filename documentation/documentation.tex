\section{Overview}

The documentation is meant as a guide for the developer. Additional aid is
found in the source header files where most functions are documented.

\section{Source Files}

In this section an overview of the project files are given.
The files are listed in order of relevance.

\section{Schematic}

In figure \ref{fig:circuit} the circuit is shown. The value of R1-R7, C1 and C5-C7
is only approximate. You can try different values. In addition to these
components two Sparkfun Qwiic Alphanumeric Displays are used. One of the
displays must be modified to disable the pull-up resistors and change the slave
address to \texttt{0x71}.

\end{figure}

\section{State Machine}

The state machine for clock mode is in \texttt{main.c} and the state machine
for the menu mode is in \texttt{menu.c}. They are implemented using the
\texttt{goto} statement which can lead to hard to understand code.  To give the
programmer a better overview of the states and make development easier some
states are documented here and shown in flow-charts. The program starts in the
\texttt{enter\_clock\_mode} state. The clock mode state machine is illustrated
in Figure \ref{fig:clock-state}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \input{clock-state}
    \caption{The clock mode state machine}
    \label{fig:clock-state}
\end{figure}

The menu mode state machine is a bit more complicated. A simple overview is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:menu-flowchart}. There are three basic state types in the
menu. \emph{Menu} states, \emph{choose} states and \emph{set} states. The menu
states are very simple. Each show some text on the display, then wait for a
button interrupt. If the \texttt{L} or \texttt{R} button is pressed the
state is changed to the previous or next menu state. If the \texttt{SP} button
is pressed it is changed to a choose or set state.

A choose state is used when there is multiple options for the setting that is
edited. For example when changing time. A choose state first shows the current
value of that setting, sets an RTC alarm for when it is changed and waits for
an interrupt. If the interrupt is from the RTC the new value is shown. If it is
from the \texttt{L} or \texttt{R} buttons the state changes to the previous or
next choose state. If it is from the \texttt{SP} button the state changes to
the corresponding set state.

A set state works a lot like a choose state. A RTC interrupt changes the value
shown and \texttt{SP} interrupt changes state (go back to the choose state).
But a \texttt{L} or \texttt{R} button interrupt de- or increments the value
instead.

Figure \ref{fig:choose-and-set-state} shows the program flow between a choose
and a set state in detail. The actual implementation varies slightly
between types.
